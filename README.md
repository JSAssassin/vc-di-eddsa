# EdDSA Data Integrity Cryptosuite

ðŸš§ This linked data suite specification is under development DO NOT use this in production. Breaking changes will be pushed regularly.

This specification describes a Data Integrity Cryptosuite for use when creating or verifying a digital signature using the twisted Edwards Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) and Curve25519 (ed25519). The approach is accepted by the U.S. National Institute of Standards in the latest FIPS 186-5 draft and, after ratification, is expected to meet U.S. Federal Information Processing requirements when using cryptography to secure digital information.

The specification defining the cryptography suite is available at the following URL: [https://w3c-ccg.github.io/di-eddsa-2020/](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/di-eddsa-2020/)
